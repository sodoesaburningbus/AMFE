Welcome to the Atmosphere Model for Education (AMFE)
AMFE is a one-dimensional (sometime called single-column) numerical
weather precition (NWP) model. AMFE, contrary to other NWP software,
is not optimized for speed or physical completeness, but rather for transparency
and useability. That said, AMFE is a functional NWP model that can be used to understand
the physical processes of the atmospheric boundary layer. If AMFE is the family car where
new drivers learn, other NWP models are Ferraris.
Welcome to the world of numerical weather prediction. All models are wrong, but some are
useful. May AMFE be useful to you.
